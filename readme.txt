CF Whiteboard turns your website and WOD Blog into a full-featured CrossFit<sup>&reg;</sup> workout tracker.

== Description ==

CF Whiteboard is a [CrossFit<sup>&reg;</sup> workout tracker](http://cfwhiteboard.com) that integrates into your affiliate's website. It adds a Whiteboard widget to your WOD blog posts, and creates athlete profiles where your athletes can search past results, look up benchmark workouts and PRs, see charts of their progress over time, see charts of their attendance over time, and more.

We want to create a service that CrossFitters love, so don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:affiliatesupport@cfwhiteboard.com) with any questions or feedback. We have helped most of our gyms with setting up a custom Whiteboard position, adding the Athletes page to their main menu, and other wordpress-related requests. Let us know how we can help!
